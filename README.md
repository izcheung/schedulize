## Summary
Schedulize is an app to help students break their assignments up into manageable pieces, and prioritize their time to reduce stress and burn-out, and help them achieve a positive work life balance. Schedulize is a web application built to help students' reduce stress and improve their well-being by providing students a calendar that shows them the optimal time to complete their assignments. Students can input their course schedules, answer questions about when they are most productive, and input information about their assignments. Each assignment is given a priority score based on when the assignment is due and how much the assignment is worth. Using their course schedule, productivity information, and assignment priority scores, Schedulize schedules times for students to work on their various assignments. This saves students the time of trying to find time for homework and studying themselves and alleviates students' stress by giving them a clear plan on how they can tackle their workload.
